<p>We’re still finalizing our list of invited speakers, but once it’s ready, you will find a description of their work and research here. They’ll be sharing insights on exciting topics in complex systems science, from social science and network science to collective behavior and beyond.<br>
Stay tuned for updates!</p>

        <h3>Rafael Prieto-Curiel</h3>
        <p>
          Rafael Prieto-Curiel is a Faculty Member at the Complexity Science Hub, where he works on topics including violence, mobility, migration, and urban dynamics.
          He works for the OECD and the World Bank, conducting spatial and demographic analyses of cities. He is the Scientific Advisor of Aleph.
          In 2024, he was awarded the “Science Breakthrough” award by the Falling Walls Foundation.<br>
          Previously, he was at the Mathematical Institute of the University of Oxford, working on urban dynamics as part of the Peak Urban project. He earned an MSc in Statistics and a PhD in Mathematics and Security and Crime at UCL.
          He also worked in the Emergency Attention Centre in Mexico City (C5) as Director of Strategic Analysis, where his work primarily consisted of crime forecasting and police and resource allocation.

        <h3>Carmen Cabrera-Arnau</h3>
        <p>
          Carmen Cabrera is a Lecturer in Geographic Data Science (Assistant Professor) at the Geographic Data Science Lab, within the University of Liverpool’s Department of Geography and Planning. Her areas of expertise are geographic data science, human mobility, network analysis and mathematical modelling. Carmen’s research focuses on developing quantitative frameworks to model and predict human mobility patterns across spatiotemporal scales and population groups, ranging from intraurban commutes to migratory movements. She is particularly interested in establishing methodologies to facilitate the efficient and reliable use of new forms of digital trace data in the study of human movement. <br>
          Prior to her position as a Lecturer, Carmen completed a BSc in Physics, followed by an MSc in Complex Systems, specialising in Network Analysis. She then did a PhD in Applied Mathematics at University College London (UCL), focusing on the development of mathematical models of social behaviours in urban areas, against the theoretical backdrop of agglomeration economies. After graduating from her PhD in 2021, she was a Research Fellow in Urban Mobility at the Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA), at UCL, where she currently holds a honorary position

        <h3>Luis F Seoane</h3>
        <p>
          Luis F Seoane is a researcher in Complex Systems—working in that field in a very general sense. He has
          contributed studies to computational neuroscience, evolutionary dynamics, network theory, econophysics,
          or linguistics—among others. Very often, these studies tackle how a system’s complexity is changed as
          the system varies in size, number of components, number of parts, etc; and vice-versa: how a system’s
          complexity might affect its growth and constituting units. Since July 2025, he works at the Institute for
          Evolutionary Biology (IBE, UPF-CSIC) in Barcelona, where he heads the BIT Lab. Earlier, he completed
          postdocs at MIT, IBE, the Institute for Interdisciplinary Physics and Complex Systems (IFISC) in Palma
          de Mallorca, and the Spanish National Center for Biotechnology (CNB, CSIC) where he first launched the
          BIT Lab in 2023.
