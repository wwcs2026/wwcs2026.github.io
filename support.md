At our workshop, accessibility and inclusivity have always been at the core of our philosophy. We believe that every young researcher, regardless of their financial means, should have the opportunity to participate and benefit from our program. Thanks to our collaboration with the [**FundaciÃ³n Sicomoro**](https://www.fundacionsicomoro.org/), we are excited to announce two registration fellowships that will make it even easier for young researchers to be a part of this experience. These fellowships will cover the full registration fee, allowing these two people to join our workshop at no cost. Furthermore, we will also allocate a portion of the funds towards travel grants. Please send us an email with a motivational letter (200 words) and a list of needed funds to our email address [wwcs2024@gmail.com](mailto:wwcs2024@gmail.com). -->
