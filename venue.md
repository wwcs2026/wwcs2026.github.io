[Santuari de Lluc](https://www.lluc.net/en/) is an ancient monastery located in the heart of the Serra de Tramuntana, an outstanding mountain range in the north of Mallorca Island. This spiritual center has been a place of pilgrimage for centuries, making it an ideal place to study, connect with nature and immerse yourself in the culture of the region.

The venue offers double rooms with private bathrooms and spacious meeting rooms that can be adapted for presentations or collaborative work. It also features inviting outdoor areas â€” not only within the accommodation grounds, which even include a botanical garden, but also throughout the surrounding Tramuntana mountains, with numerous hiking routes suitable for all levels.

The venue takes care of all your meals and coffee breaks, considering various dietary requirements, including vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free, and allergy restrictions.
