The Winter Workshop on Complex Systems (**WWCS**) is a one-week workshop where young researchers from all over world come together to work on interdisciplinary projects around complex systems. The primary focus of the workshop is to *connect* participants from different research disciplines to peers with a shared interest in complex systems while working on novel research projects. Participants are free to propose research projects, whose preliminary results are presented at the end of the workshop.

The workshop originates from the initiative of few individuals attending the [Santa Fe Institute Summer School on Complex Systems](https://www.santafe.edu/engage/learn/programs/sfi-complex-systems-summer-school) in 2014. The group sequentially became part of the WWCS Steering Committee. Over the years, the workshop has grown into a larger community attracting young researchers from all over the world. In addition, the workshop's importance for the complexity science community was awarded by the Complex Systems Society in 2022 during the Complex Systems Conference in Palma ([Service Award](https://cssociety.org/event/c08452ce-9986-4bf7-8b33-cb72a9bb50c9)).
