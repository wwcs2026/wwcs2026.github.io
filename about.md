The Winter Workshop on Complex Systems (**WWCS**) is more than just an opportunity to collaborate on research projects —  it’s also a chance to meet people from diverse backgrounds and disciplines who share a common interest in complexity science, all within a friendly and collaborative environment. The workshop is designed as a week-long gathering that brings together young researchers from around the world, with diverse academic profiles, united by their curiosity for complexity science and their drive to work on novel, interdisciplinary projects.

## Our values

The workshop is grounded in several fundamental principles. Firstly, it aims to cultivate fresh cientific collaborations that span multiple disciplines, giving rise to innovative solutions to the most pressing issues related to complex systems. These collaborations often lead to subsequent **publications in high-level scientific journals**, such as [Physical Review E](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.99.052311), [Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-98147-w#Ack1) and [International Interactions](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03050629.2021.1860034), which are the result of projects born in previous editions of the workshop. Secondly, the workshop features invited speakers who present state-of-the-art research and offer mentorship throughout the event, ensuring that **participants receive high-quality scientific guidance**.

Another core value of WWCS is **independence**. The workshop was created by early-career researchers who wanted to build a space where young scientists could explore and develop their own research ideas freely. This spirit encourages creativity, curiosity, and a true passion for science. **Diversity** is also a keystone of the workshop.  The selected participants come from an array of different backgrounds, ensuring a richness of ideas, perspectives, and experiences. The workshop is designed to be affordable, with a low registration fee that makes it accessible to early-stage researchers who may have limited travel budgets. In addition, **financial support may be available for selected candidates**, further increasing the inclusivity of the event. 

Finally, the workshop organizers aim to  create a communtity whose links last well beyond the workshop’s end. By fostering a collaborative and supportive environment, the organizers hope to offer an enjoyable and fruitful experience for all participants. That is also why **participants are encouraged to propose research projects**, and their preliminary results are presented at the end of the workshop.

## Origin and recognitions

The workshop originates from the initiative of a few individuals attending the [Santa Fe Institute Summer School on Complex Systems](https://www.santafe.edu/engage/learn/programs/sfi-complex-systems-summer-school) in 2014. The group sequentially became part of the WWCS Steering Committee. Over the years, the workshop has grown into a larger community attracting young researchers from all over the world. In addition, the workshop's importance for the complexity science community was awarded by the Complex Systems Society in 2022 during the Complex Systems Conference in Palma ([Service Award](https://cssociety.org/event/c08452ce-9986-4bf7-8b33-cb72a9bb50c9)). This workshop is an exciting opportunity for young scientists to explore new research avenues, collaborate with others, and contribute to the development of complexity science.
