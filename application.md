# Grants

We want to make sure that everyone who is interested in the winter school has a fair chance to attend. To support participants who may not have sufficient funding, we offer a limited number of grants. If you would like to be considered, please indicate this in the application form and include a short motivation letter. This helps us make sure the grants are distributed fairly. If you have any questions about the application process, feel free to <a href="mailto:wwcs2026@gmail.com?Subject=Consultation%20about%20the%20application%20process">contact us by email</a>.

## Travel grant

We hope to enable all students independent of financial means to attend the winter school. Therefore, we have reserved a limited budget for travel grants. If you are applying for a travel grant, you may upload a separate motivation letter and a list of the needded funds in the application (a different document that the cover letter for the application). With the acceptance letter, we will notify you with how much money we can support you. In case the required budget exceeds the available funds, we might not be able to cover all your needed costs.

## Other grants 

In addition to travel support, there will also be grants from partner institutions that may cover registration fees or even travel costs. We are still finalizing the details, but we will share updated information before the acceptance notifications on November 6th. If you are interested in being considered for these opportunities, please indicate this clearly in your application form.
