## Information theory of individuality
by Todd Davies, Deniz Durmus, Juan Gancio, Akanksha Khurd, Sara Neven, Patrick Schwabl, Antoine Vendeville, and Sebastian Zimper.

**Abstract:**
We implemented the [Information Theory of Individuality](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12064-020-00313-7) in a simple version of the [Voter Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_model), with the aim of detecting the emergence of ‘individual’ voting blocks.


## Capturing Emergence with NCA
by Alfredo de Bellis, Darja Cvetković, Akanksha Gupta, Max Sina Knicker, Elias Najarro, Rasha Shanaz, and Eider Pérez-Ordoyo Bellido.

**Abstract:**
Can neural cellular automata (NCA) learn the underlying dynamics of the system? We trained and tested NCA models on [game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) and Paris population data.


## Roman Empire city distribution 
by Natalia Briñas, Francesco Bertolotti, Mauritz Cartier van Dissel, Philip Mitchell, Elisa Nobile, Sabin Roman, and Pablo Rosillo

**Abstract:**
We delved into the distribution of resources and naval routes in the ancient Mediterranean, and got to reproduce the city size distribution of the Roman Empire using wave equations and ABM simulations.


## Sad Kiddos
by Adam Finnemann, Simon David Lindner, Bryn Loftness, María Martínez-Barbeito, and Franz Roman Schmid

**Abstract:**
We built an interactive dashboard exploring trajectories of childhood mental health surveys, enabling statistical, visual, and network-based exploration of individual, sub-group, and population-level trends in behavior reporting. 


## Dynamic Social Institutions
by  Pablo Flores, Felix Jäger, Zimai Li, Erica Ann Metheney, David Santiago Quevedo Vega, and Emmy Tither

**Abstract:**
We trace the evolution and potential erosion of social institutions using the example of ethnic preferences in a multi-ethnic society in south-east Africa. A combination of game theory, differential equations and agent-based modeling enables the integration of cross-scale perspectives.


## Collective dynamics in honeybee colonies (kissing bees)
by Gemma Bel, Annalisa Caligiuri, Christos Charalambous, Laura Dozal, Michael Gachomba, and Kyriacos Nicolaou

**Abstract:**
We implemented a complex system analysis of trophallaxis interactions in honeybee colonies. We investigated the presence of time correlations in trophallaxis networks, explored individual differences based on bees’ behavioral attributes, and suggested approaches to examine the relationship between burstiness and spreading dynamics comparing honeybee and human temporal networks.  -->
